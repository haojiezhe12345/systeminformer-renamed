## Fork information

This fork version of System Informer **renamed main executable from `SystemInformer.exe` to `si.exe`** to:
- Avoid being detected by anticheat software.  
  For example: AntiCheat Expert (ACE) detects this software solely on its process name.  
  (even if you rename `cmd.exe` into `SystemInformer.exe` and run it, it will say it detected hacking tools).  
  So by changing the executable name it will no longer trigger anticheat, as long as you do not read / write game process memory with this tool.

> This branch also includes a fix for the incorrectly displayed `CPU (relative)` value when custom affinity settings is applyed to a process.  
> The fix is at commit [ea9b946](https://github.com/haojiezhe12345/systeminformer-renamed/commit/ea9b946f81c0763205e97105ad517888e5013929) and is documented at [FIX_CPU_RELATIVE.md](FIX_CPU_RELATIVE.md).

### Rename details

Simply renaming `SystemInformer.exe` will could cause the plugins fail to load (as described in [SDK readme](SystemInformer/sdk/readme.txt)), because the plugin DLLs have imports from the main exeutable. So you have to rebuild them if you want to change main exeutable name.

In [`SystemInformer\SystemInformer.vcxproj`](SystemInformer\SystemInformer.vcxproj):
- Add `TargetName` with value `si`, this will override the default output binary name (you may also change it in Visual Studio in the properties dialog).

In [`plugins\Plugins.props`](plugins\Plugins.props):
- Change `LocalDebuggerCommand` to `si.exe` (for debugging purposes, not required if you're not debugging plugins).
- Replace all occurrences of `SystemInformer.lib` to `si.lib`.

In [`tools\CustomBuildTool\Build.cs`](tools\CustomBuildTool\Build.cs):
- Replace all `SystemInformer.lib` with `si.lib`.  
  This custom build tool copies the `lib` from `bin\release*\` to `sdk\lib\<arch>\` when building the main exeutable. The `lib` is used for linking the main exeutable when building plugins.

The full modifications can be found in [this commit](https://github.com/haojiezhe12345/systeminformer/commit/ed6c13c70d82f035da755dacc2af11bfd28f965f).

## Building the project

Requires Visual Studio (2022 or later).

After cloning the repo run `build_init.cmd` located in the `build` directory,
this doesn't not run again unless there are updates to the tools or third party
libraries.

Execute `build_release.cmd` located in the `build` directory to compile the
project or load the `SystemInformer.sln` and `Plugins.sln` solutions if you
prefer building the project using Visual Studio.

You can download the free
[Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
to build the System Informer source code.

See the [build readme](./build/README.md) for more information or if you're
having trouble building.

## Enhancements/Bugs

Please use the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/winsiderss/systeminformer/issues) for
reporting problems or suggesting new features.

## Settings

If you are running System Informer from a USB drive, you may want to
save System Informer's settings there as well. To do this, create a
blank file named "SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml" in the same
directory as SystemInformer.exe. You can do this using Windows Explorer:

1. Make sure "Hide extensions for known file types" is unticked in
   Tools > Folder options > View.
2. Right-click in the folder and choose New > Text Document.
3. Rename the file to SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml (delete the ".txt"
   extension).
